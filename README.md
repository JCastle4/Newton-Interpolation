# Newton-Interpolation

Program is used to compute Newton's interpolation. The program takes as input a file that contains the data points in the following format:

x0  x1  x2  ...  xn
y0  y1  y2  ...  yn

That is, the first rows contains the first element of each data point, and the next row the second one. After processing the input, the program will provide a prompt asking of a value to be used to evaluate the polynomial and print the result of such evaluation, going back to the prompt. Entering 'q' instead of a real number will exit the program.
